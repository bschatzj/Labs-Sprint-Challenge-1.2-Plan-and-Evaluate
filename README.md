## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction. Your work reflects your proficiency in user interface and your command of the concepts and techniques in team planning and product vision.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Entries This Sprint

Please respond to the following prompts to demonstrate your understanding of product vision planning sessions.

Please submit your response to your `Google Drive` folder you created in your during your first sprint of labs.

### Prompt 1: Decision Defense

Please respond to the following prompts to demonstrate your understanding of these release canvas planning sessions.

- **For data scientists and engineers:** Describe the features in your first release canvas. How do the features in your first release canvas support one another? How will the completion of the first release canvas help drive the technological decisions moving forward?


Our first release canvas is really focused on people getting logged in/ signed up. This will involve getting admins logged in to see a dashboard with all the users on it. It will also involve getting new volunteers signed up with basic contact details. Moving forward this will provide a really good base for our entire proejct to be built on top of. With a basic dashboard for the admins it will be easy to build more features on top of it. With a basic form for the new users it will be a good place to start for building on more of an actual training on top of it. 

### Prompt 2: Breakdown Entry

Describe the breakdown process of your first release canvas. Please add a link to your first release canvas in notion.

- **For non-UX students:** Summarize what you included in your first release canvas and why the features in that release canvas create a complete feature set.
- How will you test those features to know that they actually solve the problem?

First release canvas is here https://www.notion.so/d73efe185c7a46f2b1e1c63b91217f3b?v=c7351a6536e642ce934360751ab1f2b6&p=3dfe282e17e343c2bdafcf43e4e5bba4. 

We broke down the canvas this way because we think it adresses making a good base for our entire project to get built on top of. This will also adress some problems with signing up already. It will get them away from needing to enter passwords so many times in their signup proecess and just need them to log in one time. 

For our first release canvas we will view it as a success if our stakeholders like the organizational design of their preliminary dashboard. We will also be testing to see if some of their current viewers think that the sign up process is cleaner and simpler to use than their current site. 





You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section _will_ prevent you from passing this challenge.
